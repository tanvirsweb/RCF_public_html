A large number of them don\'t succeed, not due to lack of competence but because they don\'t know how to unlock their potential fully or how to adopt correct recipes for mixing the fundamental principles of attaining success. Often, we are not fully aware of our strengths and weaknesses. Many a time, we are not able to make an action plan to overcome our weaknesses and translate our strengths into concrete guidelines for attaining our goals. Principles of successful behavior are not always universal but they often change in specific cultural contexts; but as apples fall on the ground everywhere, humanity has evolved codes of basic ethics which contain acceptable human behavior all over. By and large, humans have accepted certain fundamental notions of rights and wrongs. The Bible, the Gita, the Quran, Shrutis, Srnritis, Upanishads, Dharamshastras and other religious scriptures do enlighten us on virtues of humane behavior. But a lay person finds them too complex, complicated, rich and detailed to be effectively adopted. Common people always look forward to ideas and literature that reflect simple truths about good behavior.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    With a strong introduction stating that <q>Winners don\'t do different things. They do things differently</q> the author instantaneously puts the reader at the beginning of the road to success. Like most other books this book doesn\'t preach it talks to you like a dedicated and loyal comrade. A SWOT analysis is included which gives you a complete insight to yourself. It teaches you to accentuate your strengths so that you can move forward holding your head high. It talks about your weaknesses, the reasons for your failures and gives the necessary solutions. It unfolds the various opportunities that are waiting or ignored and threats you need to overcome. Now you are running but with a stronger grip on the road.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The book tells that your attitude only makes you a winner in your life. During a study at Harvard University, it has been found that 85% of the people get promotion due to their attitude. Only 15% of the people get promotions due to their knowledge and intelligence.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The book by Khera, a management consultant of Indian origin based in the U.S., is an important attempt which seeks to provide comprehensively a simple how-to Code of <q>universal</q> <q>principles</q> <q>applicable in any situation, organization, or country</q>, but it basically targets common people. Lay persons always seek to know variegated human virtues, all put in simplest possible language, without use of jargon, presented in the form of prescriptions which they can imbibe in their behavior.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Running into eight chapters, the book covers topics such as attitude, motivation, self-esteem, interpersonal skills, values and so on. It goes to the credit of Khera that he has effectively translated complex realities related to human life into extremely simple prescriptions. He has used stories, anecdotes and examples to support his formulations. But not all these are Interesting enough. For example, the balloon anecdote with which he starts chapter one may not excite even the lay reader.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Most sermons that Khera preaches or formulations that he makes are every day <q>daadi-maan</q> (grandmotherly) prescriptions. This helps the readers a great deal in identifying themselves with the observations made or issues raised. Some of the interesting observations made in various chapters are as follows:<br>\r\n    <q>Foolish people have a strange kind of confidence which comes along with ignorance</q> ; <q>A fool speaks without thinking; a wise man thinks before speaking</q> ; <q>Whenever people succeed in life, petty people will take cracks at them and try to pull them down ... in order to fight petty people you have to come to their level</q> ; <q>winners use hard arguments but soft words</q> ; <q>Successful people compete against themselves. They better their own records and keep improving constantly</q>; <q>success is not an accident. It is result of our attitude</q>; <q>there is no magic wand for success ... [It] comes to doers, not observers</q>; <q>Most people love success but hate successful people ... critics ... are achievers who shout at doers, telling them how to do it right</q>; <q>most [organizational] members are inactive. They want and get the full benefit of the effort of the active ones</q> ; <q>the problem with lying is that one has to remember one\'s lies</q> ; <q>laughing at yourself gives you the energy to bounce back</q> ; and <q>just because more people agree on something doesn\'t make it right</q> .\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The book further takes your positivity to the peak and unmasks you to present to you the real you. No pretense, a clean and candid you all zooming ahead to procure your goal. The book serves you enough energy boosters in your run by providing action plans after every chapter that assesses you completely. You don\'t get dehydrated and are always perked up by the writer\'s style, which makes even hackneyed topics interesting. The author mentions a point, gives a logical explanation and then makes it convincing by narrating stories, jokes, quotations, and giving testimonials for the same. They are something you can relate to and are out of sheer experience. It does not enervate you as it evaluates if the reader is going through life out of inspiration (playing to win) or desperation (playing not to lose).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The book has numerous quotes, examples and short stories which keeps one\'s spirits up throughout. One of the things I like the most about the book is that the author never falls short of providing ways or methods to apply his theory. After explaining every step, he supplies us with practical solutions. From time to time, the book forces the reader to think, introspect and build his/her own <q>Action plans</q>. And following these plans religiously can work wonders. The book is a complete package for those seeking know-how about inspiration, attitude, motivation, leadership and self-esteem. Reading this book, brings clarity to one\'s goal, right attitude towards failure and success, knowledge about one\'s strengths and weaknesses and much more. The book is written in a simple, lucid and conversational manner. No specific reading time is suggested but will help the most when few bits are read daily on continual basis as it will give daily doses of motivation and inspiration and better absorption.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The central message of the book is that feelings, attitudes and relationships are extremely important for individuals as well as organizations. It portrays that knowledge is not enough for winning; winners have to learn to behave differently. This is also in consonance with the findings of research by Stanford Research Institute which concluded that <q>only 12 percent of effective management strategy is knowledge and 88 percent is dealing appropriately with people.</q> It suggests how they could be developed so as to be conducive to achieving success. All prescriptions are based on positive rather than negative attitude manifestations<br>\r\n    Interestingly, Khera does not use or quote any literature on organizational behavior or psychology to buttress his formulations. But his almost entire set of exhortations is in consonance with behavioral and business sciences, including some of the latest theoretical developments in these areas. For example, as is envisaged by the evolutionary approach to business strategy, Khera argues that <q>he [winner]must have been at the right place at the right time.</q> Likewise. one is reminded of incremental business strategy when one comes across his suggestion: <q>Successful people don\'t do great things, they only do small things in a great way</q>.<br>\r\n    Contemporary scholarship on concepts such as management of change, team management and Japanization emphasize individual as well as organizational learning, which are viewed as keys to success. Khera is aware of these developments when he suggests that: <q>a person who thinks that he knows everything has the most to learn ... only preparation will give you the competitive edge ... success gravitates to those who are prepared ... wise people learn from other people\'s mistakes</q>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The best part of Khera\'s unilateral behavioral rationality can be found in the chapters on attitudes, motivation, success. and inter-personal skills. The other positive points about the book are: lucidity of style, flawless editing, good illustration of prescriptions and excellent production. The book\'s important asset is also its encouraging tone and guiding optimism. His jaunty style helps the lay reader identify himself with the issues discussed. Undoubtedly, the lay reader finds the book quite readable and helpful.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Since Khera is a management trainer, managers would be justified in expecting the book to serve their needs as well. On this count, however, his preaching remains quite superficial. The strongest limitation from this point of view is its insistence on a pedantic, unilateral perspective which does not encourage alternative formulations; there is little room for generating fresh thinking. His admittedly <q>Universal</q> truth does not fit well in view of the changed concept of diversity management as developed within the human resource management discourse. His sweeping generalizations presuppose human beings as a homogeneous mass.<br>\r\n    Also, leadership, empowerment, trust-building and team-working find only cursory treatment. Despite the book\'s encouraging tone and guiding optimism, the reader may find the title of the book misleading when <q>benchmarking</q> has almost not been discussed. After all, 3 does not the sub-theme--winners don\'t do different things; they do things differently--promise substantial discussion on benchmarking and Kaizen in a separate chapter. That is also the topic of <q>learning</q> should have been handled. The reader finds only fleeting discussion on these terms.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Surely, the book would have been of greater interest to the manager if the exhortations had been somewhat diluted to be substituted by actual analyses of human behavior as practiced in various organizations that would show that his ideas are not mere rhetoric.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    In the major part of the book, Khera projects himself as if he is a religious guru and delivers sermons to the saintly disciple in that role. Suddenly, however, his ideal reader becomes worldly when he is exhorted <q>cashing in on an opponent\'s mistake</q> to win the war.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Also, the book is replete with repetitions. The absence of an index at the end appears irritating and a major handicap. To the extent Khera\'s audience is only the lay person, he is immensely successful in creating an impression on him which also explains why the book has seen a third reprint in less than two months of its existence. It is very good for a train journey or as a bed-time reading.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Success is a hard commodity to obtain. However, like everything in our lives, it only needs careful planning, and deliberation. All success is deliberate, there is nothing magical about winning. Using common sense and varying lessons taken from ancient wisdom to modern philosophy, he shows how we can deal with issues of our daily lives, and how we can turn otherwise bad situations into good ones. He helps readers take charge of their lives, and decide for themselves how they wish to go forwards in situations they once thought were terrible. Transforming negative thoughts into positive ones is the key, he reveals, and this book follows his motto of translating thoughts into winning actions. The attitude, motivation, interpersonal skills, self-esteem and the subconscious mind are all that matter, and it is this that the book tries to teach readers. After all, he tells us, winners don`t do different things. They just do ordinary things differently.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    This book will help generations. It is a well written book on Personality Development. Simplicity and relevance are the two main factors that make this book to stand out among other Personality Development books. The author had uncanny talent to mix the content with lot of stories and quotes so that the message does not go over the head. More and more traits were explained in simple terms with relevant and important anecdotes that make you imbibe the message with ease on an otherwise dry subject. For sure this book builds confidence on those who reads it.\r\n</p>', '2021-01-29 19:51:20', 0),

It would be luscious getting the chance of being recruited by the various companies. But it would be so frustrating if you lag behind in your field only for not having some interpersonal skills.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    What is <q>Interpersonal Skill</q> ?\r\n    Interpersonal skill means  a person\'s  behavior and deportment with others. This term is basically used to indicate the interaction process. In this business-world, interaction with others means  a lot. Even a person bearing those skills, can be valued more in his job than others.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Basically, a few are born with these skills but a big portion gain these skills with practice. They have to work hard and interact more with individuals cultivating them. Strong personal skills are too important to beat today\'s workplace.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Interpersonal Skills -<br>\r\n    There are many interpersonal skills. Some of them are -<br>\r\n    <h6>Communication skill :</h6>\r\n    It means how we communicate with others, what we say or not, how we interpret when others say anything. So, it is basically 3 types -\r\n    <ol type=\"1\" class=\"ml-3 ml-md-5\">\r\n        <li>Verbal communication</li>\r\n        <li>Non-verbal communication</li>\r\n        <li>Listening power</li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <h6>Problem solving : </h6>\r\n    Solving any organizational problem is so necessary in any job sector. It includes how to identify ,define problems,and then solve them in a perfect way.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <h6>Decision Making : </h6>\r\n    Decision making in any situation is also important. A person should make right decisions that may help his company to cope up with the environment.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <h6>Leadership : </h6>\r\n    Leaders are those who motivate a group of people to achieve the goal.

Our first 25 years pass only to accomplish the dreams of our parents. Sometimes for sacrificing our family, we start to break our dreams. We desire the choices of our parents. At the end of the day, we find ourselves in a tea tong or a cafe with a bucket of depression. I wanted to become a doctor, but as an elder son of parents, I have to helm the family, then they gave only the option to go in a technical line for completing fast graduation and steer the family. Then I chose this engineering life, but sometimes when I see my friends with white aprons, then just sighed!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Sir Thomas Alva Edison is a famous scientist and well known for his great novelty all over the world. At his early age, his teacher sent a letter that he is not capable of continuing his study in that school. But his mother started teaching at home by herself. After some years, the world got some great scientific creations like electric light, current, phonograph, etc from him. We know, our country is far behind its country. But we heard the name of the famous band musician <q>James</q> for his band Nagarbaul. When he wanted to be a musician, his family left him. He started to practice guitar in a small room with some friends in a small boarding out of his house. Now James is one of the best rock singers in the music history of this subcontinent. Famous writer Anisul Haque completed his graduation from BUET in Civil Engineering. Hopefully, God wrote him as a writer in his destiny. At the age of 10, Sachin Tendulkar failed his English exam and couldn\'t even pass the entrance exam. Now <q>Sachin Tendulkar</q> is the name of a lesson in the English book of India. Success depends on passion and determination for the subject. They preferred what they liked.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The main problem for our society is we believe in preposterous competition. Our school, colleges justify us by our marks in the exam which takes place for a few hours. If you are poor at short time memorization, you will be knocked out of the flow. We are memorizing whose theories, were they all very good at any short time test? They all were a good observer more than a good student at 90%. How you will invent something new to long term research where it is too much important for us to complete graduation with a great CGPA from a university. How can a person be wiser in all subjects equally? He should have a great influence in a special term that he loves. If he can sing or play musical instruments greatly, he doesn\'t need to write lyrics of songs. Our society likes those who earn a lot more than those who think a lot. At the end of the day, you have to maintain a family and need money. Then they stop their thinking and search for a job. The chairman of Alibaba company and multi-billionaire Jack Ma said <q>we are never in lack of money, we lack people with dreams, who can die for those dreams</q>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Depression is the most common comorbid psychiatric disorder in people who die by suicide and 39% of global suicides occur in the World Health Organization (WHO) South-East Asia Region. This systematic review aimed to identify, for countries of this region, first the prevalence of depression among people who (i) die by, or (ii) attempt, suicide, Results in The 19 articles that met the predefined eligibility criteria were from five countries: Bangladesh (1), India (12), Indonesia (1), Sri Lanka (3) and Thailand (2). Eight studies, from Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka, reported the prevalence of depression among people who had died by suicide. The study settings varied, as did the proportion of depression recorded (6.9-51.7%), and the study sample sizes ranged from 27 to 372. Eight studies from India and one from Sri Lanka investigated depression among people who had attempted suicide. Using a range of screening and diagnostic tools, the reported prevalence of depression ranged between 22.0% and 59.7%. The study sample sizes ranged from 56 to 949.\r\n(Suicide and depression in the World Health Organization South-East Asia Region: A systematic review. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28597861/\" target=\"blank\" title=\"Source\">Source</a>)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    It is important to switch the mentality of our society now. If any student wants to become an engineer, he can take his subjects what is applicable for him. If you want to become a businessman, you learn how to gain business and marketing knowledge. But there needs to be a Lil bit of change in our education sector too. Sometimes we criticize the students of other departments by saying some cheap words such as <q>it is a very easy subject</q>, <q>if I got this, I would be more successful here</q> or <q>oh! You are a student of history! I thought you were in science!</q>. You will concern a banker in the bank for your savings, not with a doctor. When you want to know the evolution of material, you have to go to an archaeologist. We go there to solve our problems.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Now come to reality. For Bangladesh, we have a shortage of jobs in every sector, if the human resource ministry works properly, how this huge population can be converted into wealth, then the pressure of jobs will be reduced. Our parents should give their children a chance to choose their profession themselves. Most of the time our engineers, doctors are rejected in megaprojects as they completed their graduation from this country, not from abroad. So what is the importance of our education system if it has no work? Engineers can be involved in such important projects, then we shouldn\'t have to appoint engineers from outside of the country. It is a sad reality for us to be unemployed after completing graduation. It is not important to search for a medical student to teach a student of class 05. A good student will be a good tutor, hopefully, it is wrong. Now the business is involved in the education sectors too. We should have a helping mentality for mankind. I believe, changing is possible if we change ourselves!\r\n</p>', '2021-01-30 07:07:58', 0),
(4, 'MD. Rabiul Hasan', 'BECM\'18', 'Exploring some internet browsing tactics for students to make a smart career.\r\n', 'assets/img/blogs/blog_default.jpeg', '<p>\r\n    We are now going through an ultra-fast development of technology than any previous era. There actually exist very few people who didn\'t hear about the term internet. Research says that on average 94% of university students have regular internet access in Bangladesh. Among them, almost all the students always prefer to browse nothing but Facebook, Google, YouTube, Instagram, and WhatsApp all the time. But The practices of using these kinds of stuff can be more productive through some simple tactics. Those tactics will make your career smarter. Let\'s explore some,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <h6>Get Connected</h6>\r\n    Actually, the internet made our life more connected. It\'s not much difficult to reach someone who is most important to you. Connectivity can make your life easier and smarter. For example, a student must have a good relationship with his/her teachers and seniors to make his/her academic life easier. But we literally ignore them or feel nervous to talk with them on social media. You can borrow expensive books or materials from teachers or seniors instead of buying. For this, you can leave a message to them over Facebook or Instagram. They will see your message whenever they are free. Again keeping the connection with them over social media you will feel comfortable while giving presentations or speeches on the class or other platforms with them.  Suppose, you want to be a content writer and earn money from your writing. Keep joining with content writing Facebook groups to get in touch with relevant peoples. Knock them over Messenger to make a relationship. Again if you are a student of Civil Engineering, keep following your alumni and organizations. Knock and make a formal relationship. You may be helped by these relationships to show your potential and get a good job.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <h6>Create a professional profile</h6>\r\n    Don\'t flood your profile with indecent information. Make your profile more professional and keep up to date with your recent productive works and experiences. This strategy will help you to show your professionalism.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <h6>Show your expertise on social media</h6>\r\n    Everyone has some potential, talent and expertise. Don\'t be shy to showcase your social media profile with those stuff you have expertise in. It may attract your recruiter or clients.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <h6>Watch Tutorials</h6>\r\n    Do not watch videos on YouTube and social media only for entertainment. Use them for distance learning. Suppose you want to be a graphics designer, there is a lot of content for beginners on Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and so on. Watch them and get practicing. If you like photography, get in touch with random photography Facebook groups and pages. There you may easily find some online photography contests. Submit your best photos on those contests and who knows you will not be the champion? In the rural areas young people get admitted to computer training centers to learn MS Office, Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator paying a good amount of money. Why do you need to get admitted to those centers paying money? If you have internet access, don\'t waste the access only for entertainment. Instead of admitting on those paid training courses watch tutorial content and get practicing. If you are enthusiastic, one you will be able to prove yourself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <h6>Use Search Engines for more efficiency</h6>\r\n    Suppose, you are looking for an idea for naming a program, why do you need to turn the pages of a dictionary? It\'s a time consuming process. Just type some keyword about the program and search it on Search Engine like google. You can easily find some wonderful ideas for naming. Again if you are not finding the solution of a problem in any of your textbooks, don\'t give up. Just search it on Search Engine. You may easily find relevant solutions to your problems. Keep researching with all of your curiosity on the Search Engines to make yourself more satisfied.\r\n</p>', '2021-01-30 07:10:55', 0),

Like everyone else I also had to confine myself in the four walls of the home and not go outside without emergencies. There is no room for doubt that the appearance of COVID-19 has a great impact on our mental health and physical well-being for being quarantined for a long time. Apart from these, I have found this pandemic a hidden blessing for myself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The greatest blessing from this quarantine is that it gave me this valuable time to create some amazing moments with my family which I overlooked sometimes for my busy schedule. This lockdown situation caused us to embrace the friends and relatives a little bit tighter even from a distance through virtual reunion. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    This catastrophe has given me a chance to practise some technical learning stuff and to develop my soft skills. In this huge time period, I have practised some online course learning  in excel, programming, supply-chain, spoken english etc. I have attended some online sessions by sitting at home with my coffee mug. A couple of them are, <q>Critical Thinking Learning</q> by Jahangirnagar University Career Club, <q>Academic Research Writing</q> by our honourable Harun Or Rashid sir , <q>Career Talk</q> series organized by RUET Career Forum and so on. I tried to make this huge time span feasible by practising web content writing as a content writer of RCF and participating in several business idea competitions. I want to mention that for the increase of online activities in this crisis especially in the educational sector, we are highly dependent on technology and it gives me this chance to make myself sharp-witted for the upcoming fast growing world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <q>Don\'t take anything for granted anymore</q>- it\'s a message for us given by the coronavirus situation. I learn that, to enjoy and to live in each and every moment of life and appreciate the simple things which make me happy are awfully important in my life. Sometimes we need to take a break from our stressful hectic life, we need to slow down and give this time to our close ones, to ourselves.\r\n</p>', '2021-01-30 07:21:23', 0),

But within the last six months of the current year (January to June), the number of rape incidents reached more than 731, the report said. Of the rape victims, 113 were gang-raped and 26 were killed after the rape. Besides, at least 123 others were made a victim of rape attempt and 70 were harassed sexually. It is seen that more than 276 women were murdered in the last six months, while 117 physically assaulted and 63 were abducted.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    There is no safety for the women at present conditions. It is a common news daily large number of women are raped or attempt to murder after rape. They can\'t work safely and go out after evening for some wild and formidable human. Women are considered as objects of luxury for men. Many times their dress is blamed as the cause of sexual harassment. Intense bigotry and blind faith have pushed people into superstition. Many of them are considered incompetent at work or he is humiliated when they move towards a big achievement. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    But what is the actual acumen behind women\'s harassment? Why are they being raped or murdered openly in front of administration? There are many causes for this vital issue such as-\r\n    <ol type=\"1\" class=\"ml-3 ml-md-5\">\r\n        <li>The weak socio-economic position of women.</li>\r\n        <li>Impact of illiteracy and poor education.</li>\r\n        <li>To consider women as a burden of society.</li>\r\n        <li>Poverty and deprivation.</li>\r\n        <li>Excessive influence of men in society.</li>\r\n        <li>Neglecting and disrespecting women.</li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n    All of these are the reasons behind women\'s harassment in our country. Now it is time to solve these social issues from our country. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    To ensure women safety in our country like all over the world we should have to take some necessary steps which will be followed strictly-\r\n    <ol type=\"1\" class=\"ml-3 ml-md-5\">\r\n        <li>Ensuring public punishment of rapists.</li>\r\n        <li>Arrange for men and women to work together everywhere.</li>\r\n        <li>Incorporate sexual awareness education in textbooks from starting study.</li>\r\n        <li>Paying attention to the behavior of boys and girls from an early age.</li>\r\n        <li>Arranging marriage after reaching puberty according to Islamic law.</li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    We need a world where there should be no racism, no sexual violence, no harassment, no murder, and rape case in society. Women are also the creation of the almighty. They also have the right to their lives with us. If our respect for women starts from the family like our mother, sister, daughter, grandmother will turn into all women. We need to change our entire mentality to change our society. In this patriarchal society, it is possible to overcome this adversity by ensuring equal rights for men and women.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <h6>Reference: </h6>\r\n    <a href=\"https://www.thedailystar.net/country/731-women-raped-in-bangladesh-in-6-months-1768477\" title=\"The Daily Star News\" target=\"blank\">The Daily Star</a>\r\n    <a class=\"ml-5\" href=\"https://www.daily-sun.com/printversion/details/508688/Rape-incidents-on-the-rise\" title=\"Daily Sun News\" target=\"blank\">Daily Sun</a>\r\n</p>', '2021-01-30 07:23:20', 0),

(8, 'Sanjida Sharmin Mrittika', 'BECM\'18', 'Why Entrepreneurship Is Important?', 'assets/img/blogs/blog_default.jpeg', '<p>\r\n    Before knowing the importance of entrepreneurship, we need to understand the meaning of entrepreneurship first. Entrepreneurship is the act of creating a business or businesses while building and scaling it to generate a profit. It\'s about building a life on your own terms. No bosses. No restricting schedules. And no one is holding you back.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Entrepreneurship is an act of being an entrepreneur, or <q>the owner or manager of a business enterprise who, by risk and initiative, attempts to make profits</q>. The entrepreneur is commonly seen as an innovator-a designer of new ideas and business processes. Management skills and strong team building abilities are often perceived as essential leadership attributes for successful entrepreneurs.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    An entrepreneur is someone who starts a side hustle that can eventually create a full-time, sustainable business with employees. Same with the freelancer. If your entrepreneurial mindset is focused on creating a profitable business, you fit the entrepreneur definition.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    There are various opportunities that an entrepreneur faces. The exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities may include:\r\n    <ol type=\"1\" class=\"ml-3 ml-md-5\">\r\n        <li>Developing a business plan</li>\r\n        <li>Hiring the human resources</li>\r\n        <li>Acquiring financial and material resources</li>\r\n        <li>Providing leadership</li>\r\n        <li>Being responsible for both the venture\'s success or failure</li>\r\n        <li>Risk aversion</li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    In recent times, entrepreneurship is much more important for a better career and a better world. Entrepreneurs see possibilities and solutions where the average person only sees annoyances and problems. Some of the major importances are:\r\n    <ol type=\"1\" class=\"ml-3 ml-md-5\">\r\n        <li>Entrepreneurs Create New Businesses: Path-breaking offerings by entrepreneurs, in the form of new goods and  services, result in new employment, which can produce a cascading effect or virtuous circle in the economy. The stimulation of related businesses or sectors that support the new venture add to further economic development.</li>\r\n        <li>Entrepreneurs Add to National Income: Entrepreneurial ventures literally generate new wealth. Existing businesses may remain confined to the scope of existing markets and may hit the glass ceiling in terms of income. New and improved offerings, products or technologies from entrepreneurs enable new markets to be developed and new wealth created.</li>\r\n        <li>Community Development: Entrepreneurs regularly nurture ventures by other like-minded individuals. They also invest in community projects and provide financial support to local charities. This enables further development beyond their own ventures.</li>\r\n        <li>Entrepreneurs Create Social Change: Through offering unique goods and services, entrepreneurs break away from tradition and reduce dependence on obsolete systems and technologies. This can result in an improved quality of life, improved morale, and greater economic freedom.</li>\r\n        <li>Improve standard of living: The standard of living refers to a certain level of wealth, various types of goods and services, materials, comforts and all the necessities available to a definite portion of people.</li>\r\n        <li>Create new job opportunities: Business enterprises are one of the biggest sources of jobs in a nation. When it comes to building or expanding a business, they need people to conduct their operations. In this way the sectors of jobs for different designations increases.</li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    In this competitive world, finding a job after graduation is too tough. But entrepreneurship helps us to create our own findings without any restricting schedules. It brings innovation and improvement in standard living. Creating new job opportunities is a very warming issue now. It gives us a complete new way of thinking and development. Entrepreneurship helps to create a better world and obviously a better career. So in my opinion, the practice of entrepreneurship should increase.\r\n</p>', '2021-01-30 08:24:33', 0),

In this Twenty First century, this is an irony of fact that people still have this misconception. There are thousands of fresh graduates roaming around without a job. Aren\'t they qualified enough?? Yeah, they are qualified enough. But there are some factors which cannot be obtained from bookish knowledge; having a high CGPA isn\'t enough for your dream job. Then, what\'s the key to achieve your goals??  These are extracurricular activities.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Extra-curricular activities do not add any credit to one\'s University\'s grade but  are an effective way to show how well socialized, how  engaged a person is around his community. Arts, debate, dancing & singing club volunteering work, affiliation with student newspapers & University club\'s are some good examples of extra-curricular activities.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    In this modern competitive era a person must have some personal possession and those are leadership, communication skills, critical thinking and so on. And all these skills can be developed through extracurricular activities.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <h6>Developing Leadership: </h6>\r\n    \"Leadership and learning are indispensable to each other.\"<i>- Jhon F. Kennedy</i>. Leadership is an art. The future of a company depends on the leaders. Leader, the person who motivates the people, who shows the right path to the co-workers. When you go for a job interview, recruiters seek for many skills. Leadership is the most significant one among them. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <h6>Communication & Networking: </h6>\r\n    One of the greatest significance of this extra-curricular activity is networking.  One can meet with new people, and help to build a completely new world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    These qualities make a person more qualified for jobs, makes a person confident, cheerful and many more. Besides, one can enrich his /her resume. So, it is time people change their point of view about joining a club, being affiliated with extracurricular activities and it should not be considered as a waste of time. And people should have the mindset that extra curricular activities never jeopardise our work but helps to build the dream career.\r\n</p>', '2021-01-30 08:26:25', 0),

They are not encouraged to be in a position from where they can lead. Though if we see the whole situation from another perspective with the changing world the percentage of women to lead is rising. But if we observe the entire society from afar the stereotype outlook is the vital concept here, that women are weak & can not handle the task of managing or leading.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Leadership is not an easy term to achieve because leaders need patients, courage, integrity, communication & many more. Pursuing all these traits can make a person a good leader. Behind all these leaders need acceptance & endorsement which make them a better version of themselves & day by day leaders. These two things are vital like the other traits.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    A woman in a leading position can shine because different research studies say that women are more empathetic & communicative. They enable a virtuous relationship between the members. They prefer learning with their subordinates. That makes a situation where no one remains in the dark & the efficiency escalates.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    But, most of our society does not initiate to provide encouragement & acceptance to the women whatever their qualifications are! People are apprehensive about promoting women to some managerial roles. This society still thinks women are not applicable for any education, engineering, job- sector & self-made achievements. Either the woman will go behind the door because of intolerable criticism or the woman has to fight back with all her zeal.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    From the survey, we can find out that about less than 38% of women are executing leading posts. If we scrutinize this matter, 38% of women belong to certain societies & a huge percentage of women still can not descry any glare of hope.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Our society has to move forward from being pigeonholed. We must give our women their deserved place in the workplace & create harmony. Men & women should work shoulder to shoulder to create an efficient & effective world.\r\n</p>', '2021-01-30 08:27:53', 0);

Tanvin Mahi', 'BECM\'18', 'Feasibility of Green Building in Bangladesh', 'assets/img/blogs/blog_default.jpeg', '<p>\r\n    <q>We shape our buildings, and afterwards our buildings shape us.</q><br>\r\n    <span class=\"d-block text-right\"><i>-Winston Churchill</i></span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Today we are marching through an era of modern technologies and these are going through development day by day making our lives easier. Some i.e., TV, cellular phones, cars, etc. have brought revolutionary changes in our daily life whereas some like atom bombs, advanced war-weapons, etc. have brought destructions and miseries to some nations. Moreover, some are acting as slow poisons that are gradually pushing the living beings especially the animals towards fatal diseases even death. They directly strike on the environment making it vulnerable for us. For example, most often the chemical liquids and sometimes by-products ejected from different industrial factories get to nearby water bodies without purification process and their poisonous substances get mixed with water making it unsuitable for various types of animals living under water. Even various types of buildings can play a vital role damaging the environment by having an unplanned disposal system of wastages. To solve the above problems, <q>Green Building</q> is a solution into which we can turn our regular buildings.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    First of all, let\'s get introduced with the term <q>Green Building</q> and what its functionalities are. A Green Building is one which uses less water, optimizes energy efficiency, conserves natural resources, generates less waste, and provides healthier space for occupants throughout the lifespan of the building as compared to conventional buildings. It is also known as green construction or sustainable building. It contributes to saving the environment by fighting against global warming and reducing pollution, wastages and preserving raw materials, energy and water and maximizing the whole life-cycle performance of the buildings.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Housing and Building Research Institute (HBRI) took the first initiative for the First Government Green Building in Bangladesh in 2007. The name of the first project of this initiative was The Eco-Housing Project and this project was designed by Ar. Md. Nafizur Rahman. The HBRI drafted the protocol for green building in 2012 with the help of IFC-world bank and in this year, a new topic on Energy Efficiency and Sustainability was also added in BNBC. Ar. Md. Nafizur Rahman drafted the Building Energy and Environment Rating System for Bangladesh in 2018 for the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA). In the private sector, EPIC group constructed the first green building in Bangladesh in May 2011. Bangladesh Green Building Council founder Sanwar Azam had worked to unify the stake-holders towards a greener country since 2008. He also offered a centralized board to offer Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certifications to the projects and firms that are interested for the same purpose. He proposed a voluntary rating tool which is much cheaper to attain and one that is suitable to the socio-economic conditions of the country and germane to its building environment and construction culture. By 2012, the Ministry of Public Works began to study the energy and water efficiency and emissions reductions with the World Bank through Green Building Codes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    There are some technological features that can be used to make a building green. They are,\r\n    <ol type=\"1\" class=\"ml-3 ml-md-5\">\r\n        <li>Rainwater harvesting systems are usually placed on the roof and collect rainwater to flush toilets.</li>\r\n        <li>Solar panels are used to heat bath water.</li>\r\n        <li>Wind turbines can be used to generate electricity.</li>\r\n        <li>Rainwater channeled into water butts can be used to water plants or wash cars.</li>\r\n        <li>Composting techniques for food scraps and biodegradable materials can be used to reduce waste and make the garden soil fertile.</li>\r\n        <li>Dual-flush toilets help conserve water with controlled water outlet options, etc.</li>\r\n        <li>Electrochromic smart glasses can be used to harness energy or shield the home from heat.</li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n    The usage of above techniques can also make the building run as a self-powered building.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    There are still some obstacles in the way of constructing green buildings. Firstly, it is expensive to install the above-mentioned technologies in the building. Secondly, there is lacking in public awareness and political support to uphold this revolutionary project. But these problems can be tackled if the government as well as the Citizens can see this from this point of view that green buildings can save 25-35% of total energy and 39% of water compared to conventional buildings. And this thinking is essential to an effective result to our environmental, economical and social sectors of our country.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <h6>References:</h6>\r\n    <a href=\"https://solarimpulse.com/green-building-solutions?utm_term=sustainable%20construction&utm_campaign=Solutions&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=1409680977&hsa_cam=11451944566&hsa_grp=117528791008&hsa_ad=475011813056&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-14405633&hsa_kw=sustainable%20construction&hsa_mt=b&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=CjwKCAiAu8SABhAxEiwAsodSZKBPCRVV0flnIeiD8sovnvVZGzU_66DgTS6U37scaNHtFY9JDIRW2BoCZoEQAvD_BwE#\" title=\" Reference on SolarImpulse\" target=\"blank\">SolarImpulse</a>\r\n    <a class=\"ml-5\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_building_in_Bangladesh\" title=\"Reference on Wikipedia\" target=\"blank\">Wikipedia</a>\r\n</p>', '2021-01-30 08:29:06', 0);

(1, 'Tazbinur Rahaman', 'A Simple News', 'Who doesn\'t love to travel? A sudden plan tour has some special kind of feelings. A tour of a foreign country is always exciting. And it becomes more awesome if you get a chance without any travel fee!!! Yeah, i got a free tour to Kolkata, India & we made plan & started our journey in just 2 hour notice!.\r\n\r\nSounds crazy? The story starts with my rich friend Khalid Syfullah in January 2020 when it was our vacation time & Khalid planned to visit Sikkim, India with a group of my other friends. But unfortunately (fortunately for me btw) he missed the flight somehow but the team already has gone. Khalid had only 7 days left for his Indian visa to expire so he had to make a trip to India as he hasn\'t yet visited India with that visa. But the problem is Khalid didn\'t visit India previously so his family was worried to allow him to go to India for the very first time without any company. But on the other hand, I made my first trip to India in 2019 already. So I was kind of tour guide guy to Khalid.\r\n\r\n11 January 2020 , full vacation time of 9 days. I was sitting in my room in Rajshahi working on my interview project of the Hult Prize Foundation Internship Program. Khalid suddenly messaged me & told me the whole thing. As he had to make a trip, he offered me to go to Kolkata, India for 3 days with him & he will bear my travel & hotel cost. So I had to bear only my food & shopping cost. For just one minute, I was like Holy shit! Am I dreaming?! I called him & he was serious about this offer. I thought why would I miss this kind of free offer!? My passport was in Jashore, so I need to go to Jashore before I got to India. But the fortunate thing is there is a direct bust service from Rajshahi to Kolkata which goes over Jashore. But the bus passes Jashore at 3:30 am which is a quite impossible time to stop the bus & go to my house, bring my passport & again sit on the bus. But without thinking so much, I agreed & said Khalid to book two tickets on the bus which will depart from Rajshahi that night 12:15 am. We were talking this at 10 am - 12 pm. Then I needed to go to Jashore to bring my passport. There was a bus at 2:30 pm from Rajshahi to Jashore. I prepared a backpack & my laptop & sit on that bus. The bus reached Jashore at 8.00 pm. Then I went home, took a small amount of money, get my passport & get ready. At night around 4.00 am I get on the bus from Jashore & reached the Benapole check-post at 5.00 am. After passing immigration we landed on Indian soil at around 9:00 am. Then our bus took us to Kolkata at around 1.00 pm. Then we took a selfie & let our friends at Sikkim to know that thus we\'re in Kolkata.', '2020-12-18 00:00:00', 0),
