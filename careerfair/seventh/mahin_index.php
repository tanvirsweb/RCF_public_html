                Thereafter RCF has been arranging its flagship Career event every following year on campus. This fair
                has been a great opportunity for undergrad and fresh graduate students from RUET as well as the north
                Bengal region to introduce them to the corporate world. Students have been able to judge their
                efficiency and quality throughout the event. Following every year, in 2022 RUET Career Forum arranged
                the 7th RCF Career Fair. Students and fresh graduates got the opportunity to submit their resumes to
