                  RCF DevTeam was started as a training group for members of RCF interested in the web development sector. The whole training session consisted of two stages. In the first stage, students were trained in front end development, with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. After some assessments, the second stage began with a few selected participants based on their performance in the first stage. In the second stage, they learned about the backend development of a website with PHP and MySQL. Then after further assessments, two members were selected to build and maintain the official website for RCF along with DevTeam’s current project director Md Tazbinur Rahaman (ECE 16).
